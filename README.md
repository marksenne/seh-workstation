# Software Engineering Hub Workstation
This repository is used to house template files and other repository infrastructure that we envision being used by the Software Engineering hub.

## What's in this repository?
- [Issue Templates](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) provide various templates that users can choose when creating a new issue.
  -   [Bug Report](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
  -   [Feature Request](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)
  -   [Technical Debt](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/technical_debt.md)
- [Pull Request Template](.github/pull_request_template.md) helps aid with pull request documentation.
  - Multiple templates can be made but structure would need to change and only on template would be selected as default. More details can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository).
 
## What else might I want to use?
- [.gitignore Templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore)
  - A collection of useful .gitignore templates. Some provided templates that may be popular: Node, Python, Java, Kotlin, etc.
  - Alternatively, use [gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io) to generate a `.gitignore` file for your project
